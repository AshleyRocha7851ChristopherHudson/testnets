# Cosmos Testnets

This repo collects the genesis and configuration files for the various Cosmos
testnets. It also includes a [status file](STATUS.md) with up-to-date
information about the latest testnet.

This repo exists so the Cosmos-SDK repo does not get bogged down with large
genesis files and updates to the STATUS.md file.

To get started with the latest testnet, see the
[docs](https://cosmos.network/docs/getting-started/full-node.html).

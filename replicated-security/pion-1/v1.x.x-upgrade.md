# Upgrade Neutron from v1.0.1 to TBD

* June 14 2023
* 15:00 UTC
* Halt height TBC

### Recommended configurations

in config.toml:
```toml
timeout_commit = "1s”
```

in app.toml:
```toml
minimum-gas-prices = “0.01untrn,0.005ibc/C4CFF46FD6DE35CA4CF4CE031E643C8FDC9BA4B99AE598E9B0ED98FE3A2319F9,0.05ibc/F082B65C88E4B6D5EF1DB243CDA1D331D002759E938A0F5CD3FFDC5D53B3E349"
```

### Timeout commit

Timeout commit corresponds to how long we wait after committing a block, before starting on the new height. It is intended to ensure there is enough time after reaching 2/3 pre-commits for all validators to join before the next block is started. 

Having tested numerous thresholds on nodes across the world with various latencies, including on the Replicated Security testnet, we found that 1s was a conservative parameter that would improve blocktime and therefore user experience without negatively affecting uptime.

Once all validators update their config, this should help bring blocktime down to 2.5-3s from its current 5.4s.

### Gas fees

Neutron’s economic model depends on transaction fees. In general, we recommend setting the minimum fee to around $0.05 which we believe is a good compromise between accessibility and revenue for Neutron and the Hub. 

To provide a better onboarding experience and diversified revenue streams, we recommend setting the minimum-gas-prices in app.toml for three denominations:

* uNTRN: the native token
* ATOM: ibc/C4CFF46FD6DE35CA4CF4CE031E643C8FDC9BA4B99AE598E9B0ED98FE3A2319F9
* axlUSDC: ibc/F082B65C88E4B6D5EF1DB243CDA1D331D002759E938A0F5CD3FFDC5D53B3E349

You can use the following line to set the gas prices to roughly $0.05 for ATOM and axlUSDC (NTRN will need to be adjusted after the launch event, once it has a price):

```toml
# Sets the fees to 0.01 NTRN, 0.005 ATOM and 0.05 USDC
minimum-gas-prices = “0.01untrn,0.005ibc/C4CFF46FD6DE35CA4CF4CE031E643C8FDC9BA4B99AE598E9B0ED98FE3A2319F9,0.05ibc/F082B65C88E4B6D5EF1DB243CDA1D331D002759E938A0F5CD3FFDC5D53B3E349"
```

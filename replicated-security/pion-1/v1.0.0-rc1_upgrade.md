# Steps to upgrade neutron chain (pion-1)

## Step 1 : All upgrades will be done using cosmovisor.

* stop the neutron chain

```shell
   sudo systemctl stop neutrond
```

* Delete the wasm cache folder
```shell
rm -rf ~/.neutrond/wasm/wasm/cache/
```

* Further follow the cosmovisor setup guide.

# Setup Cosmovisor

## Create the updated Neutron binary of v1.0.0-rc1

Due to miscommunication in the releases versions upgrade process was made for version `v0.4.4` but this version was tagged later as `v1.0.0-rc1`. 
So in order to run upgrade properly we will be required to create proposal for version name `v0.4.4` but install `v1.0.0-rc1`.

```shell
   mkdir -p ~/.neutrond/cosmovisor/upgrades/v0.4.4/bin
```
* Go to neutron directory if present else clone the repository

```shell
   git clone https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron.git
```

* Follow these steps if neutron repo already present

```shell
   cd $HOME/neutron
   git pull
   git fetch --tags
   git checkout v1.0.0-rc1
   go mod vendor
   make install
```

## Check current neutron version
```shell
   ~/.neutrond/cosmovisor/current/bin/neutrond version
   # Output should be
   0.4.2
```

## Check the new neutron version, verify the latest commit hash

```shell
  $ neutrond version --long
  name: neutron
  server_name: neutrond
  version: 1.0.0-rc1
  commit: a735ee5cb359b53ce3833741847c784da3c66411
```

## Copy the new neutron (v1.0.0-rc1) binary to cosmovisor upgrades directory

```shell
   cp $GOPATH/bin/neutrond ~/.neutrond/cosmovisor/upgrades/v0.4.4/bin
```

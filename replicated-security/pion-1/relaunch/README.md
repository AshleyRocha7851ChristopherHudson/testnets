# `pion-1` Chain Details

The `pion-1` chain will be launched as a Neutron persistent chain to test Interchain Security functionality.

* **Chain-ID**: `pion-1`
* **denom**: `untrn`
* **minimum-gas-prices**: `0untrn`
* **timeout_commit**: `1s`
* **Spawn time**: `2023-06-29T14:30:00Z`
* **GitHub repo**: [neutron-org/neutron](https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron.git)
* **Release**: [`v1.0.2-pion-1-upgrade`](https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron/releases/tag/v1.0.2-pion-1-upgrade)
* **Genesis file with CCV state:** [pion-1-genesis.json](TODO)

* **Reference binary**: [neutrond-linux-amd64](./neutrond-linux-amd64)
* **Binary sha256sum**: `a1331685f656cca2d7a94283959678a5a3c846aa4a6fa0cd6c4da1534c324ea7`
* **Genesis file _without CCV state_:** [pion-1-genesis-without-ccv.json](https://storage.cloud.google.com/neutron-data/pion-1-genesis-without-ccv.json.gz), verify with `shasum -a 256 pion-1-genesis-without-ccv.json`
* **SHA256 for genesis file _without CCV state_**: `02a239f8c32829901de97100bfe573518a1193b8923133a43590ff974974989b`


* Genesis file hash
  * The SHA256 is used to verify against the genesis file (without CCV state) that the proposer has made available for review.
  * The `pion-1-genesis-without-ccv.json` file cannot be used to run the chain: it must be updated with the CCV (Cross Chain Validation) state after the spawn time is reached.
  * The genesis file includes funds for a relayer and a faucet account as well as account with funds for different internal needs, `signed_blocks_window` has been set to `2304000`, and `min_signed_per_window` has been set to `5%`.
* Binary hash
  * The `neutrond-linux-amd64` binary is only provided to verify the SHA256. It was built with Interchain Security release [`v1.0.2-pion-1-upgrade`](https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron/releases/tag/v1.0.2-pion-1-upgrade). You can generate the binary following the build instructions in that repo or using one of the scripts provided here.
* Spawn time
  * Even if a proposal passes, the CCV state will not be available from the provider chain until after the spawn time is reached.

> If you want to build genesis by your own please take into account difference between the `ccvconsumer` section generated by version v9.0.2 of `gaiad` and the `ccvconsumer` section required for neutron to run. Please check and add `"soft_opt_out_threshold": "0.05"` to the `params` section if it absent.

For more information regarding the consumer chain creation process, see [CCV: Overview and Basic Concepts](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/blob/main/spec/app/ics-028-cross-chain-validation/overview_and_basic_concepts.md).

## Endpoints

Endpoints are exposed as subdomains for the sentry and snapshot nodes (described below) as follows:

## How to Join

### Hardware Requirements

* 4 Cores
* 32 GB RAM
* 2x512 GB SSD

### Software Versions

| Name    | Version               |
|---------|-----------------------|
| Neutron | v1.0.2-pion-1-upgrade |
| Go      | >1.20                 |

The scripts provided in this repo will install Neutron and set up a Cosmovisor service with the auto-download feature enabled on your machine.

#### Bash Script

The script provided in this repo will install `neutrond` and set up a Cosmovisor service on your machine. 

Run script provided to set up a `pion-1` service:
* `join-rs-pion-1.sh` will create a `pion-1` service with `cosmovisor` support.
* Script must be run either as root or from a sudoer account.
* Script will attempt to build a binary from the [neutron-org/neutron] repo.

### Node manual installation

Build and install neutron binary. 

```
$ git clone -b v1.0.2-pion-1-upgrade https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron.git
$ cd neutron
$ make install
```

after installation please check installed version by running:

`neutrond version --long`

You should see the following:
```
name: neutron
server_name: neutrond
version: 1.0.2-pion-1-upgrade
commit: bb9d1c2d58dba07620b9ec0a4e32d36b59ef6cb2

```

### Troubleshooting

If you see error like this during startup

`Error: maximum number of retries exceeded, last error: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = failed to load state at height 0; version mismatch on immutable IAVL tree; version does not exist. Version has either been pruned, or is for a future block height (latest height: 0): invalid request`

everything you can do is to stop node, reset state (`neutrond tendermint unsafe-reset-all --home ~/.neutrond --keep-addr-book`  ) and start node again.

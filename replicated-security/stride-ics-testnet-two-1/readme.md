# `stride-ics-testnet-two-1`

Stride's launch on the Replicated Security Testnet will be a little different from previous consumer chain launches. Previous chain launches spawned a new chain from a fresh genesis state, but Stride already exists as a sovereign chain.

### How will the sovereign -> consumer chain transition work on the Replicated Security testnet?

* Stride side: The Stride team is running their own testnet (chain-id: `stride-ics-testnet-two-1`). That testnet will perform a software upgrade and at the upgrade height (shortly after the spawn time) it will transition to the provider chain‚Äôs validator set.
* Provider side: There will be a consumer-addition proposal for the stride chain. Shortly after the spawn time, we will receive the CCV state. This CCV state will be used to patch the original stride chain‚Äôs genesis file.

### What do you need to do to participate in the launch on Wednesday?
See the table below for a breakdown of steps you'll need to follow throughout the process. 

## ‚ö†Ô∏è  Complete STEP 1 (join Stride testnet with a full node) ASAP ‚ö†Ô∏è
Follow along with Stride's block explorer here: https://ics-explorer.stride.zone/stride 

For step 1, you can try using Stride‚Äôs joining script here: https://github.com/Stride-Labs/mainnet/blob/ics-testnet/ics-testnet/join_ics_testnet.sh 

Otherwise you may manually join `stride-ics-testnet-two-1` using these notes:
* Joining instructions: https://github.com/Stride-Labs/mainnet/tree/ics-testnet/ics-testnet
* Genesis file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stride-Labs/mainnet/ics-testnet/ics-testnet/genesis.json
* Pre-transition stride binary commit: `a3eff2dc`
* Stride‚Äôs GitHub repository: https://github.com/stride-Labs/stride
* Building instructions for stride‚Äôs binary: `make install`
* Go version: 1.19
* Persistent Peers = `"d747545dbab1eb86caff7ec64fca3b7f2ace07fd@stride-direct.testnet-2.stridenet.co:26656"`
* Chain ID: `stride-ics-testnet-two-1`
* Post-upgrade stride binary commit (run with this binary after the upgrade): [`e7a01bcdb0f192cb028638ccd25f02f9f8b73ad4`](https://github.com/Stride-Labs/stride/commit/e7a01bcdb0f192cb028638ccd25f02f9f8b73ad4)
  * You can also build with [this Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/layers/stridelabs/ics-testnet/stride/images/sha256-3268198b39fa9e3b6107f352f49d28c5c78939e1147370b166f848dbd112186e?context=repo)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Stride-Labs/stride.git
cd stride
git checkout a3eff2dc
make install
strided init stride-node --chain-id stride-ics-testnet-two-1

# Grab the genesis file
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stride-Labs/mainnet/ics-testnet/ics-testnet/genesis.json -o $HOME/.stride/config/genesis.json
```

* Start stride node, node should start catching up
* Node will panic at UPGRADE_HEIGHT_TBD
* Stop the node

Download v11 Binary
```sh
cd stride
git pull
git checkout e7a01bcdb0f192cb028638ccd25f02f9f8b73ad4
make install

#Should be v11
strided version
```

Make directories in cosmovisor and copy binaries
```
mkdir -p $HOME/.stride/cosmovisor/upgrades/v11/bin/
cp $HOME/go/bin/strided $HOME/.stride/cosmovisor/upgrades/v11/bin/
```

Download new Sovereign genesis
```
mkdir -p $NODE_HOME/config/
wget -O $NODE_HOME/config/ccv.json URL_TBD_PENDING_SPAWN_TIME
```

Restart the Service
```
sudo service stride restart && journalctl -u stride -f -o cat
```

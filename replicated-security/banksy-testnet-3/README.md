# banksy-testnet-3 ICS Testnet

### How will the sovereign -> consumer chain transition work on the Replicated Security testnet?

* Composable side: The Composable team is running their own testnet (chain-id: `banksy-testnet-3`). That testnet will perform a software upgrade and at the upgrade height (shortly after the spawn time) it will transition to the provider chainâ€™s validator set.

* Provider side: There will be a consumer-addition proposal for the Composable chain. Shortly after the spawn time, we will receive the CCV state. This CCV state will be used to patch the original Composable chainâ€™s genesis file.

|Client |`Available soon`| `Available soon`|

### Joining before transition
All provider validators must join `banksy-testnet-3` before the upgrade and `spawn_time`, using released binary:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin
wget https://github.com/notional-labs/composable-centauri/releases/download/v5.0.0/centaurid -O $HOME/go/bin.centaurid
chmod +x $HOME/go/bin.centaurid
sudo wget -P /usr/lib https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm/raw/main/internal/api/libwasmvm.x86_64.so
centaurid version # v5.0.0
centaurid init <moniker> --chain-id banksy-testnet-3

# Genesis file without ccv module
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notional-labs/Composable-ICS-tesnet/main/genesis.json -O $HOME/.banksy/config/genesis.json

# run node
centaurid start --p2p.seeds c0f197bdf6c4a4a16eb9db112d1ec9545336fd43@168.119.91.22:2250
```
Or building binary from source:
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/notional-labs/composable-centauri
cd composable-centauri
git checkout v5.0.0 # Using v5.0.0
make install
centaurid version # v5.0.0
```

### Upgrade and apply new genesis file
The node will start running until the upgrade height, at which the node will halt. Detail about timeline and instruction can be seen at **Launch Stages** section. To download new ccv file at `spawn_time`, and apply new version after upgrade height, see following commands:
```bash
# Download new genesis-ccv at `spawn_time`
wget -O $HOME/.banksy/config/ccv.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cosmos/testnets/master/replicated-security/banksy-testnet-3/ccv.json
```

```bash
# Installing centaurid v6.0.1-ics
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/notional-labs/composable-centauri
cd composable-centauri
git checkout v6.0.1-ics # Using v6.0.1-ics
make install
centaurid version # v6.0.1-ics

# run node
centaurid start --p2p.seeds c0f197bdf6c4a4a16eb9db112d1ec9545336fd43@168.119.91.22:2250
```

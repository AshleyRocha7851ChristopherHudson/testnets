# `banksy-testnet-3`



### How will the sovereign -> consumer chain transition work on the Replicated Security testnet?

* Composable side: The Composable team is running their own testnet (chain-id: `banksy-testnet-3`). That testnet will perform a software upgrade and at the upgrade height (shortly after the spawn time) it will transition to the provider chain‚Äôs validator set.

* Provider side: There will be a consumer-addition proposal for the Composable chain. Shortly after the spawn time, we will receive the CCV state. This CCV state will be used to patch the original Composable chain‚Äôs genesis file.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è  Complete STEP 1 (join Composable testnet with a full node) ASAP ‚ö†Ô∏è
Follow along with Composable's block explorer here: https://explorer.nodexcapital.com/banksy-testnet

Otherwise you may manually join `banksy-testnet-3` using these notes:
* Joining instructions: https://github.com/notional-labs/Composable-ICS-tesnet
* Genesis file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notional-labs/Composable-ICS-tesnet/main/genesis.json
* Pre-transition Composable binary commit: ``
* Composable‚Äôs GitHub repository: https://github.com/notional-labs/composable-centauri
* Go version: 1.20
* Persistent Peers = 
* Chain ID: `banksy-testnet-3`
* Post-upgrade Composable binary commit (run with this binary after the upgrade):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Composable-Labs/Composable.git
cd Composable
git checkout a3eff2dc
make install
Composabled init Composable-node --chain-id Composable-ics-testnet-two-1

# Grab the genesis file
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Composable-Labs/mainnet/ics-testnet/ics-testnet/genesis.json -o $HOME/.Composable/config/genesis.json
```

* Start Composable node, node should start catching up
* Node will panic at UPGRADE_HEIGHT_TBD
* Stop the node

Download v11 Binary
```sh
cd Composable
git pull
git checkout ed3fcf9512ee136a03b58a7cd1d21b0e002de06f
make install

#Should be v11
Composabled version
```

Make directories in cosmovisor and copy binaries
```
mkdir -p $HOME/.Composable/cosmovisor/upgrades/v11/bin/
cp $HOME/go/bin/Composabled $HOME/.Composable/cosmovisor/upgrades/v11/bin/
```

Download new Sovereign genesis
```
mkdir -p $NODE_HOME/config/
wget -O $NODE_HOME/config/ccv.json URL_TBD_PENDING_SPAWN_TIME
```

Restart the Service
```
sudo service Composable restart && journalctl -u Composable -f -o cat
```

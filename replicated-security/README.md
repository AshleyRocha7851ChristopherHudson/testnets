# Replicated Security Persistent Testnet

The Replicated Security (RS) persistent testnet will be used to test Interchain Security features.

This testnet includes the following:
* A provider chain
* Consumer chains
* Relayers
* Block explorers
* Faucets

## Status

#### Next consumer chain launch: ?

Stay tuned!
